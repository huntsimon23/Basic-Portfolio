    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <img src="./assets/images/Simon Headshot Sept2016.jpg" alt="Taken Circa 2016" height="200px" width="200px">

    <p> I have had the blessing to have many career opportunities, and I am excited to begin this latest adventure in web development.  My time in accounting, Radio, sales, entertainment, live sound, and most recently Christian ministry have given me multiple perspectives from which to view the world.  Web development will undoubetly open me to further perspective shifts,which I eagerly anticipate!  

    <p> I am a son of Jamaican immigrants, but Florida born and raised.  I have a beautiful wife and a 4 year old daughter who are both avid game players.  I hope to make many fun games for them over the next few years!</p>

    <p>While databases, matricies, and other ways to organize information have always fascinated me, it's Jesus and people that I truly love.  Through all of the experiences I've head, I hope to use all of what I have been given -love, knowledge, and otherwise- to give back. I'd like to make contributions to the world around me that help other people in daily life at some level through web development.</p>
